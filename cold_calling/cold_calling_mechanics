Important elements:
   1. Get the persons attention
   2. Identify your self and your company
   3. Give the reason for your call
   4. Make a qualifying/questioning statement
   5. Set the appointment
   
Get the persons attention
-------------------------
Let's assume I'm calling you. Depending upon what I say, you're going to respond.
No matter what I say, you're going to respond somehow.
"And the better I get at my opening, the more likely I am to get a good response from you!"

People respond in kind.
When you try to get the person's attention, remember that people responsd in kind.

***
   You don't need permission to call somebody back. If people don't want to take the call,
   they're not going to take the call.
   
   Dont talk fast or lie or mislead people to get appointments.
***


Identify your self and your company
-----------------------------------
Say, "
   Good morning, Mr. Jones, this is steve schiffman from D.E.I here in new york city. 
   We're a major sales training company that's worked with over 500,000 salespeople.
"


Give the reason for your call
------------------------------
When calling for an appointment, I suggest you say the following:
"The reason I'm calling you today specifically is to set an appointment". instead of simply
saying, "The reason I'm calling is to set an appointment".

better version: 
"
   The reason I'm calling you today specifically is to set an appointment so I can stop by and 
   tell you about our new sales training programs and how they can increase the productivity of your 
   sales force.
"

***
   Convey, the I'm calling to set an appointment. Thats' it!.
***


Make a Questioning or Qualifying statement
------------------------------------------
Now, I'm going to add a questioning statement that's going to allow the prospect an opportunity to
respond to me in kind favourably.

The question that I'm going to ask has to be based on my reason for calling Mr. Jones.

My qualifying or questioning statement has to follow easily and logically from that statement.
It has to be a resonable and nonmanipulative extension of what's gone before.


***
   I could say, "Mr. Jones, are you interested in having qualified salespeople?" The problem is, 
   that kind of question can produce a negative response. Beacause there are actually people who
   will say "no" in response to that question": "No, I'm not interested in increasing my sales."
***

A better way to start out is, "Mr. Jones, I'm sure that you like a lot of the other companies that I work with.."
and here I insert some real names. 

I should sound like:
  "
   I'm sure that you, like ABC Company, are interested in having a more effective sales staff.
  "
  Mr. Jones is much more likely to say, "Yes, I'm interested."
  
  
  Set the appointment
  --------------------
 We should say, "That's great, Mr. Jones, then we should get together. How's Tuesday at 3:00?"
 
 Be specific, The request must be this direct, this brief, and this specific. Don't change it!
 ***
   Don't say, 
   "Well, thats great! Then we should get together. What's better for you-this week or next week?
   . Whats better for you-Monday or Tuesday?. Whats better for you morning or afternoon?"
 ***

Now the discussion focuses on when we're going to get together, not whether we're going to get together.
Now I have a better chance of getting the appointment.
