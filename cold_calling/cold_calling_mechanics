   else is calling!

  Stand Up
  --------
     Stand up when you make your calls!. It is more productive than I had been when I was sitting down.
     
     When you stand up and make cold calls, you're going to sound real. You're going to feel better about
     yourself. You are going to sound better.
  ***
Get the persons attention
-------------------------
Let's assume I'm calling you. Depending upon what I say, you're going to respond.
No matter what I say, you're going to respond somehow.
"And the better I get at my opening, the more likely I am to get a good response from you!"

People respond in kind.
When you try to get the person's attention, remember that people responsd in kind.

***
   You don't need permission to call somebody back. If people don't want to take the call,
   they're not going to take the call.
   
   Dont talk fast or lie or mislead people to get appointments.

Identify your self and your company
-----------------------------------
Say, "
   Good morning, Mr. Jones, this is steve schiffman from D.E.I here in new york city. 
   We're a major sales training company that's worked with over 500,000 salespeople.
"


Give the reason for your call
------------------------------
When calling for an appointment, I suggest you say the following:
"The reason I'm calling you today specifically is to set an appointment". instead of simply
saying, "The reason I'm calling is to set an appointment".

better version: 
"
   The reason I'm calling you today specifically is to set an appointment so I can stop by and 
   tell you about our new sales training programs and how they can increase the productivity of your 
   sales force.
"

***
   Convey, the I'm calling to set an appointment. Thats' it!.
***


Make a Questioning or Qualifying statement
------------------------------------------
Now, I'm going to add a questioning statement that's going to allow the prospect an opportunity to
respond to me in kind favourably.

The question that I'm going to ask has to be based on my reason for calling Mr. Jones.

My qualifying or questioning statement has to follow easily and logically from that statement.
It has to be a resonable and nonmanipulative extension of what's gone before.


***
   I could say, "Mr. Jones, are you interested in having qualified salespeople?" The problem is, 
   that kind of question can produce a negative response. Beacause there are actually people who
   will say "no" in response to that question": "No, I'm not interested in increasing my sales."
***

A better way to start out is, "Mr. Jones, I'm sure that you like a lot of the other companies that I work with.."
and here I insert some real names. 

I should sound like:
  "
   I'm sure that you, like ABC Company, are interested in having a more effective sales staff.
  "
  Mr. Jones is much more likely to say, "Yes, I'm interested."
  
  
  Set the appointment
  --------------------
 We should say, "That's great, Mr. Jones, then we should get together. How's Tuesday at 3:00?"
 
 Be specific, The request must be this direct, this brief, and this specific. Don't change it!
 ***
   Don't say, 
   "Well, thats great! Then we should get together. What's better for you-this week or next week?
   . Whats better for you-Monday or Tuesday?. Whats better for you morning or afternoon?"
 ***

Now the discussion focuses on when we're going to get together, not whether we're going to get together.
Now I have a better chance of getting the appointment.


All Together now
---------------
Steve: Goog morning, Mr. Jones, this is steve schiffman from D.E.I here in New York City.
Were a major sales training company; We've worked with more than 500,00 sales peoples.
The reason I'm calling you today specifically is so I can stop by and tell you about our
new sales training program and how it can increase the productivity of your sales force.

I'm sure that you, like ABC, are interested in having a more effective sales staff.

---- Positive response ----
That's great, Mr. Jones. I think we should get together. How's Tuesday at 3:00?


Getting past the gatekeeper
---------------------------
Call at Early in the moring or late night. Chance of speaking to the person directly is high. 


Don't make repeat calls
-----------------------
Don't call that company. If somebody gives you a hard time, say, "Thank you very much, have a good day",
and hang up. Then call someone else.
